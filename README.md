Interactive type square that combines information from MBTI, Socionics, and Michael Pierce.

Hover your mouse over a type (or click it if you're on a mobile device) to see the Socionics relationships between the selected type and the others.

All the types in a row have the same function stack, albeit in different order. This corresponds to the quadrants from Socionics. The strongest sensor is on the left, the strongest intuitive on the right.

Edits to remove Kiersey include Model G names of types.
