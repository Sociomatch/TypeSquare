Interactive type square that combines information from MBTI, Socionics, Model G
and Michael Pierce.

Hover your mouse over a type (or click it if you're on a mobile device) to see
the Socionics relationships between the selected type and the others.

All the types in a row have the same function stack, albeit in different order.
This corresponds to the quadrants from Socionics. The strongest sensor is on the
left, the strongest intuitive on the right.
